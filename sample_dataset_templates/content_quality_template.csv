"summarize","The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has transformed multiple industries. Machine learning algorithms now power recommendation systems in e-commerce, diagnostic tools in healthcare, autonomous vehicles in transportation, and fraud detection in finance. However, concerns about job displacement, privacy, and algorithmic bias have emerged. Companies must balance innovation with ethical considerations while governments work on regulatory frameworks.","max_length: 50 words, style: neutral","AI has transformed industries through ML-powered systems in e-commerce, healthcare, transportation, and finance.

Plants take in carbon dioxide from the air through their leaves and water through their roots.

This process happens in the green parts of plants, which is why leaves are usually green.
